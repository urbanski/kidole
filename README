Kidole - a url fingerprinting tool
=========
Kidole is a passive URL fingerprinting tool. It attempts to passively identify web applications, web services, and systems that may be running on a web server by fingerprinting URLs that have been recorded. Kidole is passive and will not query or make requests from a web service. Kidole is helpful for identifying the types of services that are being requested, or are being probed for. For example, using a network monitoring platform you can record all inbound HTTP requests that result in HTTP 200 OK. These could then be analyzed with Kidole to determine if any well known web applications are being accessed.

Kidole supports python regular expressions.
